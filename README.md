# Charlotte FC 2025 Mid-Season Review

This project presents a mid-season tactical and statistical analysis of Charlotte FC during the 2025 MLS campaign. Built as part of the UNC Charlotte Sports Analytics Practicum, the goal was to extract insights from match data and present findings to Fc's Data Analytics Team.

## 📈 Key Metrics Analyzed
- xG & goal production
- Build-up play: passes to final third, progressive passes
- Defensive engagement: duels, aerials, PPDA
- Tactical shape, player availability, and trends over time

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Home vs Away Split
Charlotte FC is a **playoff-level team at home (6-0-2)** but ranks in the **bottom third on the road (2-1-7)**.

### Tactical Identity
- High **xG** and **progressive pass accuracy**
- **Low pressing intensity** (high PPDA)
- Below-average **aerial duel success**
- Relies on structured build-up and transitions

### Style of Play Comparison
Charlotte FC’s tactical profile (high PPDA, low possession) places them in **Quadrant 1: "Slow build-up, defend mid-block"**.

This quadrant-style graph categorizes teams by **pressing intensity** and **ball control style**:

| Quadrant | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🔲 **Top Left** | *Low Possession, Low Pressing* — Teams that sit in a mid/low block and don’t chase the ball aggressively. |
| 🔲 **Top Right** | *High Possession, Low Pressing* — Teams that dominate the ball but defend more passively (possession-focused, slower transitions). |
| 🔲 **Bottom Left** | *Low Possession, High Pressing* — Pressing teams that don’t dominate the ball (counter-pressing or transitional style). |
| 🔲 **Bottom Right** | *High Possession, High Pressing* — Intense, dominant teams that press high and keep the ball (typically elite). |
