# Charlotte FC 2025 Mid-Season Review

This project presents a mid-season tactical and statistical analysis of Charlotte FC during the 2025 MLS campaign. Built as part of the UNC Charlotte Sports Analytics Practicum, the goal was to extract insights from match data and present findings to Fc's Data Analytics Team.

## 📈 Key Metrics Analyzed
- xG & goal production
- Build-up play: passes to final third, progressive passes
- Defensive engagement: duels, aerials, PPDA
- Tactical shape, player availability, and trends over time

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Home vs Away Split
Charlotte FC is a **playoff-level team at home (6-0-2)** but ranks in the **bottom third on the road (2-1-7)**.

### Tactical Identity
- High **xG** and **progressive pass accuracy**
- **Low pressing intensity** (high PPDA)
- Below-average **aerial duel success**
- Relies on structured build-up and transitions

### Style of Play Comparison
Charlotte FC’s tactical profile (high PPDA, low possession) places them in **Quadrant 1: "Slow build-up, defend mid-block"**.

![Style of Play Chart](visuals/cltfc_style_of_play_quadrant.png)

This quadrant-style graph categorizes teams by **pressing intensity** and **ball control style**:

| Quadrant | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🔲 **Top Left** | *Low Possession, Low Pressing* — Teams that sit in a mid/low block and don’t chase the ball aggressively. |
| 🔲 **Top Right** | *High Possession, Low Pressing* — Teams that dominate the ball but defend more passively (possession-focused, slower transitions). |
| 🔲 **Bottom Left** | *Low Possession, High Pressing* — Pressing teams that don’t dominate the ball (counter-pressing or transitional style). |
| 🔲 **Bottom Right** | *High Possession, High Pressing* — Intense, dominant teams that press high and keep the ball (typically elite). |

## 📈 Charlotte FC – Strengths & Weaknesses (vs. Eastern Conference Avg)

This table compares Charlotte FC’s midseason metrics to the 2025 Eastern Conference average:

### 🟢 Strengths

| Metric                        | Charlotte FC | East Avg | Insight                                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **xG**                       | 1.70         | ~1.55    | Top-third chance creation — Charlotte consistently gets quality looks. |
| **Goals**                    | 1.65         | ~1.57    | Finishing aligns with expected output — efficient attacking execution. |
| **Progressive Pass Accuracy**| 73.6%        | ~69.2%   | Among the best in the East — shows precision in moving the ball forward. |
| **Smart Passes / Accurate**  | 1.47         | ~1.45    | Strong use of through balls and line-breaking passes.                  |
| **Average Pass Length**      | 19.89        | ~18.3    | Slightly longer passing style — favors direct buildup over short exchanges. |
| **Match Tempo**              | 17.13        | ~17.0    | Keeps a steady pace, reflective of a structured and intentional style. |

### 🔴 Weaknesses

| Metric                | Charlotte FC | East Avg | Concern                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Aerial Duels Won**  | 22.18        | ~27.8    | Among the lowest in the East — vulnerable on crosses and set pieces.   |
| **PPDA**              | 17.17        | ~13.6    | Applies less defensive pressure — indicates passive, mid-block defending. |
| **Conceded Goals**    | 1.59         | ~1.52    | Slightly elevated — potentially tied to limited pressing and aerial issues. |
| **Defensive Duels Won**| 56.29       | ~59.4    | Slightly below average — opportunity to improve defensive engagement.  |
| **Throw-in Accuracy** | 18.12        | ~18.9    | Minor technical detail, but could affect ball retention.               |

### ⚖️ Balanced Metrics

Charlotte sits near the conference average in:

- **Passes to Final Third / Accurate**: 54.94 (East Avg ~54.5)
- **Set Piece Shots**: 23.41 (East Avg ~24)
- **Counterattacks w/ Shots**: 0.94 (East Avg ~0.9)

These are stable but not standout categories, representing maintenance areas rather than focus areas for tactical adjustments.

### 🧠 Tactical Takeaways

Charlotte FC is a team that **thrives on structured progression**, effective buildup, and patient attacking phases. While they generate and convert chances well, they:
- Avoid high pressing
- Struggle physically in the air
- Could benefit significantly from set piece improvements and deeper defensive engagement

These observations reinforce Charlotte’s placement in the **“low possession, low pressing”** quadrant — a team that plays in a compact block, breaks forward efficiently, but must tighten up off the ball.
